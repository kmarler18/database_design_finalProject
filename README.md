# database_design_finalProject
For the final project in my database design class, I designed a database for the on-campus food pantry. 

The pantry needed help tracking metrics such asâ€¦ 

<ol><li>How often students visit the pantry.</li>
  <li>If they were given a free tote bag.</li>
  <li>Whether they are part time or full time.</li>
  <li>Family size.</li></ol>

While designing the database, I was able to practice many concepts I learned in the class including normalization, SQL, QBE, form creation, queries and reports. 

My professor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/patty-santoianni-249877279/" target="_blank">Patty Santoianni</a>, was impressed with my work noting that most students didn't take on a real-world problem.

It was a great experience gathering requirements and conducting a miniature SDLC while meeting with end-users such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-massie-ph-d/" target="_blank">Dr. Matt Massie</a>.
